		<h1><i>money</i></h1>
		<p> Money means not how much you have or what you buy, but how you realize your dream.</p> <p> For me today there is a more precious resource than money, and that is my time.</p> <p> I can not buy the time with money. I can not go back, so today I try to check very well what I will do.</p> <p> Money allows me to choose what to do over time.

		<p>Towards the end of the month I like to put money in my investment portfolio and trade in that money, and what I would earn I would put into savings</p>
